# Weather_shell
A shell script that tells you the weather in a fun little manner!

Q:Why did you make this?
A: I wanted to learn shell and decided the best way is to make something that will tell me the weather when I log in on the computer!

Q:Are you going to do anything else with this?
A: Maybe! I have some ideas and want to start getting into the cybersecurity field so these projects will help teach me and show I know the code!

Q: Do I have to do anything?
A: Yes! At the current moment you must enter your lat and long while also putting in your own openweather API keys! The are free!
